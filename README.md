# Analyzing Kickstarter Project Data 

In this project, I have stepped into the role of a data analyst to explore and analyze Kickstarter project data using SQL. I have started by importing and exploring the dataset collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kemical/kickstarter-projects/data), followed by cleaning the data to ensure accuracy. Then, I have written SQL queries to uncover trends and insights within the data, such as success rates by category, funding goals, and more. 

The goal of the project is to investigate:

- What types of the projects are most likely to be successful?
- What types of projects fail and why?
